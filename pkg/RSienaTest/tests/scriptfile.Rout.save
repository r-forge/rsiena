> #
> # RscriptDataFormat.R is followed by
> # RscriptSienaVariableFormat.R, which formats data and specifies the model, and
> # RscriptSienaRunModel.R, which runs the model and estimates parameters
> # RscriptSienaBehaviour.R, which illustrates an example of analysing the
> # coevolution of networks and behaviour
> #
> # The entire model fitting is summarised at the end of RscriptSienaRunModel.R
> # (without comments)
> #
> # This is an R script for getting started with RSiena, written by
> # Robin Gauthier, Tom Snijders, Ruth Ripley, Johan Koskinen, and
> # Paulina Preciado, with some examples borrowed from Christian Steglich.
> # Lines starting with # are not processed by R but treated as comments.
> # The script has a lot of explanation of R possibilities that will be
> # familiar for readers well acquainted with R, and can be skipped by them.
> #
> # A terrifically easily accessible online introduction to R is given at
> #
> #        http://www.statmethods.net/
> #
> # R is case sensitive.
> # The left-arrow "<-" is very frequently used: it denotes an assignment,
> # "a <- b" meaning that object a gets the value b.
> # Often b is a complicated expression that has to be evaluated by R.
> 
> # Help within R can be called by typing a question mark and the name of the
> # function you need help with. For example ?library loading will bring up a
> # file titled "loading and listing of packages".
> # Comments are made at the end of commands after #,
> # or in lines staring with # telling R to ignore everything beyond it.
> # This session will be using s50 data which are supposed to be
> # present in the working directory.
> # Note that any command in R is called a function;
> # in general the command syntax for calling R's functions is function(x) where
> # function is a saved function and x the name of the object to be operated on.
> # For new R users:
> # note that there is a lot of documentation available at
> # http://cran.xl-mirror.nl/other-docs.html
> # including some short introductions, handy reference cards,
> # and introductions in a lot of languages besides English.

> #
> # The introductory script is divided into the following script files:
> # RscriptDataFormat.R, followed by
> # RscriptSienaVariableFormat.R, which formats data and specifies the model, and
> # RscriptSienaRunModel.R, which runs the model and estimates parameters
> # RscriptSienaBehaviour.R, which illustrates an example of analysing the
> # coevolution of networks and behaviour
> # Written with contributions by Robin Gauthier, Tom Snijders, Ruth Ripley,
> # Johan Koskinen, and Paulina Preciado.
> #
> # This script, RscriptSienaVariableFormat.R, sets up the variables for analysis.
> # The manipulations in this script requires that you have gone through the
> # first part, "CALLING THE DATA AND PRELIMINARY MANIPULATIONS",
> # of the script "RscriptDataFormat.R" beforehand;
> # or that you have defined the data and the model by means of the
> # siena01Gui() function and have saved and loaded the results,
> # as described in Section 2.3.3 of the Siena manual.
