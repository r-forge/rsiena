Description: Simulation-based estimation of stochastic actor-oriented models 
   for longitudinal network data collected as panel data. Dependent variables 
   can be single or multivariate networks, which can be directed, non-directed, 
   or two-mode. There are also functions for testing parameters and checking
   goodness of fit. An overview of these models is given in Tom A.B. Snijders
   (2017), Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for Network Dynamics, 
   Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 4, 343-363,
   <doi: 10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054035>.
