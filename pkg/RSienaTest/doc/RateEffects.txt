Rate effects are currently of three types, 
defined by the rateType column of allEffects.csv.
The values are "structural", "diffusion", "covariate", or NA.

Function DependentVariable::initializeRateFunction in Dependentvariable.cpp 
initializes the rate function; here also the functions 
model/effects/StructuralRateEffect.h and 
model/effects/DiffusionRateEffect.h 
are used. 

Functions StatisticCalculator::calculateNetworkRateStatistics and 
StatisticCalculator::calculateBehaviorRateStatistics in StatisticCalculator.cpp 
calculate the rate functions.

The RateX effect is defined in a funny way. 
If you look for the string "RateX", it occurs nowhere in the cpp directory. 
It is identified by being the only rate effect of type "covariate", 
together with the dependent variable name and the explanatory variable, 
given by the parameter "interaction1".
