\title{Notes for Developers of RSiena}
\author{Ruth Ripley}
\date{}
\maketitle

\centerline{\emph{\today}}
\bigskip

The introduction to the RSiena manual describes the basics of how to run the
program, either `standalone' or within R. The help files in R describe how to
use the R commands. Here I give some notes for developers.

Note that this file changes fairly frequently.
\section{Documentation}
\subsection{Getting the documentation: Windows Users}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install TortoiseSVN. This will also install \textsf{svn}
    and a version of \textsf{plink}.\\
    Installation of TortoiseSVN may be sensitive. It is advised to
    install it when no other programs are running, and after installing
    to restart your computer immediately.
    A successful installation will show by having items
    SVN Checkout and TortoiseSVN
    in the popup window opening at a right mouse click in Windows Explorer.
\item If you have not already done so, \emph{register} on r-forge and ask to
  join RSiena.
\item When you get an email saying you have been allowed to join RSiena,
  go to R-forge RSiena SCM tab at
  \url{https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/?group_id=461} and find the address of
  the repository:
\url{svn+ssh://developername@svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rsiena}
\item Go into Windows Explorer and create a folder to hold the source files.
\item Navigate to this directory.
\item Right-Click and select SVN Checkout...
\item Paste the repository address in the top box, replace the word
  \emph{developername} by your r-forge user name and hit OK
\item When it finishes, you will have the source of RSiena and RSienaTest, in
  subdirectories of the \textsf{pkg} directory.
\item Each of RSiena and RSienaTest has the same basic layout of files, but
  RSienaTest has some extras: documentation source.
\item The documentation is in RSienaTest/doc.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Getting the documentation: non-Windows Users}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you have not already done so, \emph{register} on r-forge and ask to
  join RSiena.
\item When you get an email saying you have been allowed to join RSiena, go to
  R-forge RSiena SCM tab at
  \url{https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/?group_id=461} and find the checkout
  command: \sfn{\small svn checkout
    svn+ssh://developername@svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rsiena} replacing
\verb|developername| by your name.
\item Create a folder to hold the source files.
\item In a terminal window, navigate to this directory.
\item Type the checkout command.
\item On Macs, you could try using \textsf{svnX} rather than the terminal
  interface.
\item When it finishes, you will have the source of RSiena and RSienaTest, in
  subdirectories of the \textsf{pkg} directory.
\item Each of RSiena and RSienaTest has the same basic layout of files, but
  RSienaTest has some extras: documentation source.
\item The documentation is in RSienaTest/doc.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Automatically generated documentation}
\begin{description}
\item[C]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install \sfn{Doxygen} and \sfn{GraphViz}
\item Use the configuration file \sfn{RSienaTest/doc/config.dox} to run the
  Doxywizard. On Windows you need the File/Open \texttt{config.dox} (in
  \texttt{RSienaTest/doc}).  On a Mac, you need to use the expert/dot tab in the
  Wizard, and enter \texttt{/usr/local/bin} in the box marked DOT\_PATH. On
  Linux I do not know!
\item The documentation is a set of html files. Open one and then you can
  navigate round the set.
\end{enumerate}
\item[R]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the function \sfn{RSiena:::getRSienaRDocumentation()} with the
  argument set to the path to your R source files for RSiena or RSienaTest.
\item This generates a .csv file, a latex table or an R data frame (called
  tmp12) with details of the functions in. To make the csv more readable,
  autofit the columns and save as .xls.
\item NB You need RTools (see later) installed to do this on Windows.
\end{enumerate}
\item[Table of functions for the manual]
\begin{enumerate}
\item The file \sfn{document.r} in \sfn{RSienaTest} contains a function
  \sfn{RSienaAutoHelpTable} which will generate \LaTeX source  from the .Rd
  files for a table of functions similar to that in the manual
\item You need to run \sfn{RSienaAutoHelpTables} and then run \LaTeX on the file
  \sfn{auto.tex} in the doc directory of the source (not installed) package.
\item It is controlled by a data frame of functions hard coded in the file
  \sfn{document.r}.
\item The text is based on the \sfn{Description} field in the .Rd file. Moving
  information from this field to the \sfn{Details} field should allow sufficient
  flexibility to get the required table.
\item There are a few sample text processing commands commented out in the
  source file \sfn{document.r} which might prove useful.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}
\subsection{Other documentation}
There are other documentation files:
\begin{description}
\item[RSienaSpec] Specification of the R side.  Details of creation of objects
  and \nnm{siena07} Robbins-Monro algorithm.
\item[simstats0c] Specification of C++ simulation for forward simulation
\item[maxlikec] C++ simulation for maximum likelihood estimation
\item[bayes] Bayesian function
\item[sienaTimeFix] Details of the implementation of testing for time
  heterogeneity and creation of time dummies.
\item[classdesign] Details of the C++ side.
\item[missingsEtc] Details of the treatment of missing values and structural
  values. Also describes processing of composition change.
\end{description}
This file contains a description of some ways of adapting the algorithms.

There are also a file called siena\_algorithms4,
which contain descriptions of the algorithms. It do not always match the
code, whereas I hope the files referred to above do.
\section{Updating the package on R-forge}
\subsection{A few notes about svn}
I am not an expert on this, and you do not need to know much. But a few notes
may help.
\begin{itemize}
\item R-forge will allow source files to be updated only if you have performed a
  developer secure checkout. Previously I suggested doing a read-only checkout
  first, but I now think that this is not a good idea. I recommend you go
  straight to a secure checkout and remove any other version of the r-forge
  source which you may have lying around.
 \item To make a change, edit the files you checked out and use \textsf{svn
     commit} from the same directories as you checked them out into.
 \item To get the most recent source at any time after checking out, use
   \textsf{svn update}. (A Right-click option on the directory in Windows
   Explorer for Windows users)
\item It is a good idea to do \textsf{svn update} before \textsf{svn commit}, as
  you will find out about conflicts and can solve them rather than leaving the
  repository in a conflicted state.
\item But \emph{never} do \textsf{svn update} and then copy your new versions on
  top of the updated files. This way you remove any changes between your
  checkout and the update. If you do risk this and rely on checking the
  differences, you must check for alterations in the blank spaces as well or you
  risk annoying someone who has reformatted code by removing their changes.
\item If you wish to rename or delete a file under svn control, use the svn
  options to do it. On Windows this is available via right-click from Tortoise.
\item If you add new text files of any type, set the svn property
  \textsf{eol-style} to have value \textsf{native}.  Again, available via
  Tortoise on Windows, via svnX on Mac.
\item Details of how to set up a personal/provate key pair are in section
  \ref{key}. This removes the need to type your password multiple times.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Files which always need updating}
 Before you commit an update to R-forge please do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Record details of the files you have changed in the Changelog for each of
  RSiena and RSienaTest. The two changelogs are kept identical, otherwise it
  gets very confusing.
\item Update the version number and date in the \textsf{DESCRIPTION} file for
  each package.
\item Update the version number and date in \textsf{man/RSiena-package.Rd} in
  each package.
\item If the change would be noticeable to the users, add the details to the
  change log at the end of the manual. Create a new pdf and copy to the inst/doc
  directory of each package.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Coding standards etc}
I describe the main details of our current practice:
\subsection{General}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use spaces: particularly around operators and after commas. (But
  not after the end of your lines!)
\item Do not use underscores: use variable names made up of several (possibly
  abbreviated, but ideally not) words with all but the first capitalised.
\item Use braces even when not strictly necessary in \sfn{if} and \sfn{for}
  statements and similar. (Not universal yet, but I am adding them...)
\item Align braces under each other (so put the first one on a new line). (I
  break this rule for \sfn{switch} statements in R as emacs does not do the
  alignment sensibly!)
\item Set tabs at intervals of 4 columns
\item Indent by 4
\item Align comments in the body of the code with the surrounding code.
\item Do not use lines longer than 80 characters in any file, even
  documentation.
\item New source files need their \sfn{eol-style} set to \sfn{native} when they
  are added to the repository. On Windows, right-click and select
  Tortoise-SVN/properties then add \sfn{eol-style:native}.  (One current
  exception here: the file \sfn{sienascript} needs to have always unix line
  endings. Otherwise a tarball built on Windows will not produce a usable
  \sfn{sienascript} for Mac or Linux. There may be others in the future.)
\item Copy a file header from an existing source file, and adapt it.
\item Ensure your editor removes all trailing spaces.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{R}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use \verb|<-| rather than \verb|=| for assignment.
\item Use \sfn{TRUE} and \sfn{FALSE} not \sfn{T} and \sfn{F}.
\item Avoid unnecessary \sfn{for} loops. They are acceptable where a complicated
  \sfn{apply} statement would be necessary, but not where a simple vectorised
    command could be used.
  \item \sfn{R} functions need a documentation comment preceding the function
    declaration. If they have internal functions a call to \sfn{getInternals} is
    required also.
  \item \sfn{R} functions which are to be visible to the user need to be added
    to the \sfn{NAMESPACE} file, and have a help page for them : see the Writing
    R Extensions manual for the details of the format.
  \item Check that \sfn{R CMD check} works with no warnings apart from line
    endings (these are set to follow the platform, and will be OK when checked
    out on a Linux box).
  \item If writing methods, add them to the \sfn{NAMESPACE} file. Ensure that
    you get no warnings from them.
  \item \sfn{print} methods should invisibly return their argument.
  \item \sfn{summary} methods for class \sfn{objclass} should return an object
    of class \sfn{summary.objclass} which is printed by a
    \sfn{print.summary.objclass} method.
\item Avoid using the names of \sfn{R} functions as variable names. It is
  permitted but may lead to confusion.
\item Never rely on partial matching of function arguments.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{C++}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use \texttt{this-\textgreater} even when not strictly necessary.
\item If you add new files or functions, ensure they are
  Doxygen-documented by copying the comment structure at the start of file or
  function from a similar one.
\item Only include files in header files if absolutely necessary: use forward
  declaration instead.
\item All data items in classes are to be private: if derived classes need
  access provide a protected method for them.
\item Arguments lists should each be on a separate line unless all will fit on a
  single line.
\item Only declare one variable per line.
\item Use upper case for the preprocessor comments at the beginning and end of
  the header files.
\item Put comments before blocks such as Forward declarations, Class
  definitions.
\item More details of the design are in the document \emph{classdesign.tex}.
\item In particular note the naming conventions described there.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Recreating the package}
These notes apply to using R 2.12.0 or later. Please ensure you have the
latest source (which does not include commands to get the installer for
\verb|siena.exe|). If you do not then the behavior will not be as documented
below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If using Windows, download and install the matching
\textsf{Rtools.exe} from
  \url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/}.  Beware: if you later install
  other programs containing utilities such as tar (delphi is one offender), you
  may need to uninstall and reinstall Rtools, as you need Rtools at the start of
  your path. (Or edit the path!).
\item If using a Mac, you will need the Xcode tools installed.
\item Obtain the current source using a developer secure checkout.
\item In a command prompt window, navigate to the directory above the siena
  tree. Here I assume it is called \sfn{RSiena}. (You may have minor
  difficulties if it is not!)
\item Type\\
\verb|R CMD build RSiena|
\item You will probably need to either add R to your path, or use
  `path-to-R.exe' in the command above.
\item You may get warning messages from CYGWIN. This is caused by a recent
  upgrade in RTools version 2.12. To suppress the warnings, set the environment
  variable \verb|CYGWIN| to the value \verb|nodosfilewarning|. (CYGWIN may also
  give you messages if you try to use tar to unpack the tar ball. If so,
  set the environment variable \verb|TAR_OPTIONS| to
\verb|--no-same-owner --no-same-permissions|.)
\item When this one is OK, type\\
\verb|R CMD INSTALL RSiena_1.0.n.tar.gz|\\
(where \verb|n| is adjusted to match the file you have just created.)
\item You now should have a new version of the package ready for use. (If on 64
  bit Windows or Mac, you will have two versions, and you will two copies of the
  course directories.)
\item Alternatively, instead of the build and INSTALL, just type
\verb|R CMD INSTALL RSiena|\\
If you have a 64-bit Windows and R 2.12.0, or a 64-bit Mac, use
\verb|R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch RSiena|\\
instead. After the first compile, where using
\verb|R CMD INSTALL --preclean RSiena| \\is recommended,
this will just compile the C that has changed and then do the rest.
Quicker if you are debugging changes. Note that the \sfn{make} file is not very
clever: if you are altering the C and your changes are not appearing, delete the
.o's or .dll to force it, or use
\verb|R CMD INSTALL --preclean RSiena|\\
to clear out all the .o's and the dll. (\verb|R CMD build| used to clear out
.o's but it does not from R 2.13.0)
\item If you use \verb|R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch RSiena|
you get object files in the source tree. If you later want to build multi
architectures (where the object files are created in a copy of the source tree)
you need to use \verb|--preclean| to stop confusion between the different object
files.
\item On linux or Mac, the same commands should work, but you don't need the
  Rtools. I have occasionally had problems with installing from a tarball or
  from source, when I have no permission to write in the standard libraries, but
  can't remember which one worked: one always did. The most likely to work is to
  use, within R,\\
 \sfn{install.packages("tarball name", repos=NULL)}\\
 Or just
  open up R, and do \\
\verb|install.packages('xtable')| \\which should create a
  local library directory for you.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Checking the amended package}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Either run \verb|R CMD check RSiena|, or do a build, and then
  run \verb|R CMD check RSiena_1.0.n.tar.gz|. This will create a directory
  called \verb|RSiena.Rcheck|, and produce some diagnostics to the
  screen.
\item Please set environment variables to ensure you have tested everything you
  can. Details below. You should have no warnings at all from
  the tar ball version, maybe some to do with presence of object files with the
  other version.
\item Final check of pdf: once the warnings have gone away, do a visual check on
  the pdf version of the help pages which will be in the directory
  RSiena.RCheck. Check any pages you have changed for lines that are too long:
  the usage section, I think, does not wrap automatically.
\item If you just want to check the format of the help pages in the pdf, you can
  use \\ \verb|R CMD Rd2dvi --pdf man| \\ or e.g.\ \\
  \verb|R CMD --pdf man/siena7.Rd|\\ which will create a file called Rd2.pdf.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Environment variables}
 \label{below}
 The easiest way to control building and checking is to use environment
 variables. For portability between computers I suggest you set these using
 files as described here. You need a directory \verb|.R| in your home directory
 and two files in that directory:
\begin{description}
\item[.R directory] Create, in your home directory, a directory called .R (on
  Windows you will have to use mkdir in a command prompt window to do this). You
  can use this directory to provide your own version of \verb|Makevars| (useful
  for \textsf{valgrind} users on linux where you need to turn off optimisation).
\item[.check.Renviron] This file is used in the check procedure. It should
 contain at least the following:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
_R_CHECK_CODETOOLS_PROFILE_="suppressPartialMatchArgs=FALSE,
suppressLocalUnused=FALSE"
_R_CHECK_SRC_MINUS_W_UNUSED_=TRUE
\end{verbatim}
}
with no line break between the two options for CodeTools.

Until R 2.14.0 appears, you need to check the install log yourself to see the
C++ warnings, after that you should see all the warnings in the check log.

To use your own personal library tree for the check, add to this file a line
containing: \verb|R_LIBS=xxx|, where \verb|xxx| is the name of the directory
containing your installed packages.

You might like to add
\verb|_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=FALSE| which just stops the check failing because
some suggested packages which are not actually used in the code are not
installed.
\item[build.Renviron] This is the file used for the build procedure.  I suggest
  you set \verb|CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning| here. (Only necessary in Windows but
  will do no harm on Mac or Linux.). We also need
\begin{verbatim}
_R_BUILD_RESAVE_DATE=no
\end{verbatim}
but I have added this to the DESCRIPTION file.
\end{description}
\paragraph{Alternative methods for small changes}
Good news: from R 2.12.0 it is often possible to update the R functions in
RSiena without re-installing the
package.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you make a change to an R source file, you can override the package
  simply by using the R command \verb|insert.source|. For example,
  \verb|insert.source('d:/RSiena/R/phase1.r', package='RSiena')| will update any
  functions which you have altered which are contained in \verb|phase1.r|.
\item Alternatively, you can make a small change to a hidden file by using
\verb|fixInNamespace('function name', 'RSiena')|.
\item Useful to insert a call to \sfn{browser}, as you won't mind it
  disappearing when you exit from R.
\item It is likely that neither of these methods will work with S3 methods
  eg. print.sienaFit. If the function you are trying to alter does not call any
  hidden functions in RSiena, just source it and bypass the despatch mechanism
  but calling it directly. (Or add \verb|RSiena:::| in front of all calls to
  hidden functions.)
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Making  binaries}
If you want to send someone a Windows binary for some reason: on a Windows
machine, use

\verb|R CMD INSTALL --build RSiena|

Remember that you should send them the source tar ball too, for compliance with
GPL licensing.

If you are lucky the same will work with Mac binaries on a Mac, but I have not
tried this recently, and I may have forgotten some trick.
\section{Personal/private keys}
\label{key}
You can set up a personal/private ssh key pair so you do not need to type the
R-forge password. The details for Windows are: (linux and Mac users can probably
find our how to do this by googling).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install \sfn{putty.exe} and its associated programs using the putty
  Windows installer for the whole set from
  {\small{\url{http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/}}}
\item After installation, run \sfn{putty.exe} and create a session for rforge:
Use \sfn{rforgename@svn.r-forge.r-project.org} as the host name. (Use your
r-forge name in place of \verb|rforgename|.)
\item Port should be 22
\item Connection type should be \verb|ssh|.
\item Save the session with name \verb|rforge|.
\item In TortoiseSVN, check out the source using the address
  \verb|svn+ssh://rforge/svnroot/rsiena| to check your session address is
  correct. You will have to type the password twice.
\item Make the key:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \sfn{puttygen.exe}.
\item You want \sfn{SSH-2 RSA}.
\item Click \sfn{Generate}
\item Move mouse over the blank area until the key has been generated.
\item Save Private Key
\end{enumerate}
\item Login to R-forge
\item Go to Account Maintenance/Edit Keys
\item Copy the public key from the puttygen window and paste into the R-forge
  window.
\item Click Update
\item Open your putty window, load the r-forge session and find the SSH/Auth
  page.
\item Put the name (complete path) of your private key file in the box provided.
\item Defaults for other fields should be OK. (On mine the two boxes  `Attempt
  authentication via Pageant' and `Attempt keyboard-interactive auth (SSH-2)'
  are checked.)
\item Go back to the session screen (you need to scroll up the left panel!) and
  save the session again.
\item An hour later, try it out by doing another secure checkout. You should not
  be asked for your password this time.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parallel runs}
Most of RSiena is set up to produce the same results as Siena3, but some effects
have been redefined and maximum likelihood uses a different algorithm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In Siena3324xx source file \textsf{rangen.pas}, edit the lines at the
  bottom so that \textsf{version = 5} and \textsf{version2 = 6}.
\item Build siena01, siena07
\item Set the random seed to something non-zero (I use 1 but the value
  should not matter) in the .MO file.
\item It often helps to select the option to use standard starting values in the
  .MO file. This is necessary for the automatic parallel tests.
\item In R, use the argument \textsf{parallelTesting=TRUE} in the call to
  \textsf{siena07}.
\item Use the module \textsf{simstats0c} as the function when creating the
  model.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Automatic tests}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Select the correct versions of the random number generator as above.
\item Build  siena03, siena01, siena07
\item The automatic system needs some test files in the siena3324xx directory:
\begin{description}
\item[VRND32T3.DAT]
\item[VRND32T4.DAT]
\item[time23.dat]
\item[tmp34.in]
\item[effectsTest.bat]
\end{description}
There are more than one version of these data files around. The first two should
be the same as the objects tmp3 and tmp4 in RSiena. Use the same time23.dat file
in each case.
\item Create a directory in the siena3 directory called effectsTest.
\item  run \verb|siena01 tmp34|
\item Set the random seed to something non-zero (I use 1 but the value
  should not matter) in the .MO file.
\item Select the option to use standard starting values in the
  .MO file.
\item Set the number of subphases in phase2 to 2, and the number of iterations
  in phase3 to 100.
\item At the command prompt type\\
\verb|sh < effectsTest.bat|
\item and wait... (not so long now!)
\item when finished you should have 4 txt files to diff with the R ones:
  comp.txt, compc.txt, compfd.txt, compfdc.txt. They will not be exactly the
  same...
\item The R part is run by the command (somewhere else with a subdirectory
  called effectsTest, containing time23.dat):
 \verb|R --vanilla < effectsTest.R|
\item The R .txt files are in the effectsTest subdirectory, the siena3324 ones
  are in the main directory.
\item The subdirectories contain the .cck files and the equivalent from R, in
  files called things like eval\%.tmp, endow\%.tmp.
\item The .out files are stored in 4 parts: sienanonc.out, sienac.out,
  sienafdnonc.out, sienafd.out.
\item The detailed files can be used to find out more about runs that did not
  match.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Profiling}
If you are interested in knowing where RSiena spends its time, you can examine
the R part by:
\begin{verbatim}
Rprof()
siena07(...)
Rprof(NULL)
summaryRprof()
\end{verbatim}
For the C part it is a lot harder. An outline of the use of \verb|gprof|:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our set-up works for networks, behavior variables and the various
  covariates. 1 group only.
\item You will need a standalone RMath library. You can find out how to create
  this in the R-admin manual.
\item Run siena07 with the extra argument \textsf{profileData=TRUE}.
\item This creates a file called \textsf{data.txt}. Move this to the directory
  \textsf{src}.
\item In R, run the code, assuming the effects object is called \textsf{myeff}
  and you have nothing valuable called \textsf{tmp}:
\begin{verbatim}
tmp <- myeff[myeff$include,c(1,4,7,13,14,5,6,17,21,23,16)]
tmp[tmp==""] <- NA
write.table(tmp, 'effects.txt', quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE,
col.names=FALSE, na="NA")
\end{verbatim}
\item This creates a file called \textsf{effects.txt}.  Move this to the
  directory \textsf{src}.
\item In the \textsf{src} directory,
\begin{verbatim}
make -f makefile.profile clean
make -f makefile.profile
SienaProfile.exe
gprof SienaProfile.exe gmon.out > gprof.out
more gprof.out
\end{verbatim}
\item You will need to adjust the \textsf{RHOME} line in
  \textsf{makefile.profile} to reflect the location of R on your system.
\item Google for ``gprof'' to find out how to understand the output!
\end{enumerate}

There are alternatives on linux (\textsf{oprofile}) or Mac OS (\textsf{shark},
or
\textsf{Instruments/TimeProfiler}).
A few notes about each:
\begin{description}
\item[oprofile]
\begin{enumerate}
\item When I last tried, you needed root privileges to start or stop the daemon,
  and to reset it.
\item It is a resource hog.
\item The callgraph option only used to work on 32 bit machines.
\item Failed to work on Fedora 10 as installed in the statistics department, but
  possibly this has been updated.
\item \verb|opcontrol --start| to start it
\item \verb|opcontrol --callgraph=n| to get a callgraph.
\item \verb|opcontrol --reset| to start the collection again
\item Then run the R command
\item \verb|opcontrol --dump| create a file you can get reports from
\item \verb|opreport -l siena.so| to get a report. (Maybe Rsiena.so now)
\item \verb|opannotate -d src srcdir| to get annotated output
\item \verb|opcontrol --shutdown| to stop daemon
\end{enumerate}
\item[shark]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure shark is installed
\item Start it
\item Run your R command
\item Attach shark to this command.
\item During the run, click Start and then Stop  on the Shark window
\item If you have the right settings a callgraph will appear in Shark.
\item I found that saving the results usually failed to work.
\item This route and TimeProfiler are the only ones I found which would include
  C functions like exp in the profiling, although it is possible you may find a
  profiled gcc math library available for a Linux installation.
\end{enumerate}
\item[TimeProfiler]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start Instruments and select TimeProfiler
\item Use ChooseTarget to attach to the R process
\item Click Record and later Stop
\item You should be able to get a callgraph.
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

In any of these cases, you may find results vary due to garbage
collection in R. Also changes which spped up the Mac may not speed up Windows,
particularly changing memory allocation.
\section{Debugging C++}
You may find that R tends to crash when you change the C++. You can try to trap
the error using \sfn{Rprintf} statements to print out details at intervals. The
syntax for \sfn{Rprintf} is the same as the C function \sfn{printf}, but output
from the R version appears in the R console where other output will not. You
need the header file \sfn{"R\_ext/Print.h"} which may already be
included in any file I have debugged! To print out R objects (arguments or
objects you have created in the C++), use
\sfn{PrintValue(SEXP xx)}: this requires the header file \sfn{Rinternals.h}.

For debugging chains there are utility functions \textsf{getChainDF} and similar
which create a data frame from a ministep or a chain. Within C++, you can use
\textsf{PrintValue(getChainDF(...));} to produce a readable output of the
chain. There is an option to sort if you want to check how many of a particular
link occur. For initial and end states there is a more sophosticated version
which adds these as attributes and a corresponding R print method to display
them. As always, you can use sink() to get console output to a file.

If you have access to a Linux machine, you can use a program called
\sfn{valgrind} to find places where you access memory which you should not, and
similar things. The usage is described in the Writing R Extensions manual. I
use, at the command line,\\
\sfn{R -d "valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full " --vanilla < valgrind.r}
\\
where valgrind.r contains the commands I want to run, \emph{followed by
  \sfn{gc()}} to do some R garbage collection. (Otherwise \sfn{valgrind} reports
a lot of still reachable memory at the end.)

\sfn{valgrind} will also report memory leaks which may not cause an error, just
an embarrassingly large memory usage, which will fail sooner or later.

If \sfn{valgrind} reports use of uninitialised variables, use the option
\sfn{--track-origins=yes} to find out where the problem started. It can be
surprisingly difficult to track these down!
\section{The R C++ interface}
This is not easy to understand from the documentation (Writing R Extensions
manual), but there should be examples of most functions in the code
already. Some notes:
\begin{description}
\item[random numbers]
We use the R random number functions such as \sfn{rexp}. These work slightly
differently from the R versions, you need to check the syntax of the call in
the manual if adding new ones. The header required is \sfn{Rmath.h}.
\item[Random number seeds] The functions\sfn{GetRNGstate} and
\sfn{PutRNGstate}  are used to get the R random number seed into the C++
process and then replace it in the R. The header for these is
\sfn{R\_ext/Random.h}.
\item[rlecuyer]
With multiple processes we use the random numbers from the \sfn{rlecuyer}
package. The seed is set in eg \sfn{robmon} (in the R code). There is code in
\sfn{siena07.cpp} which shows how to set and reset these if you must. The
different streams are intended to be kept apart, so for finite differencing
where we need common random number streams I have advanced to a new substream at
the beginning of each real iteration and reset to this point at the beginning of
each finite difference one. The jump to the new substream ignores the current
state so it does not matter if the streams get muddled up during the finite
differencing stage.
\item[errors]
Error messages can use the function \sfn{error} which is similar to
\sfn{Rprintf} in syntax, and needs the header file \sfn{R\_ext/error.h}.
\end{description}
\section{C++ platform independence}
A few notes of problems we have had:
\begin{itemize}
\item With some compilers you need to add \sfn{<string>} if you use
  \sfn{<stdexcept>}. Often this will be included somewhere else in the path, but
  if you add \sfn{<stdexcept>} it would be good to add \sfn{<string>} also.
  \item If you work on a Mac, currently you will find it easier to remove the
    word \sfn{clean} from the make file \sfn{Makevars}. I suggest you do this in
    a personal copy in a directory \sfn{.R} in your home directory, though, so
    that when you build and check the package it will get the right one.
\item Also remove the word \sfn{clean} from the makefile on Linux.
  \item Be careful with \sfn{abs}. The integer version is in \sfn{<cstdlib>} not
    \sfn{<cmath>}. Compilation may fail with message about ambiguity.
\end{itemize}
\section{Algorithms}
This section outlines the different options available to the (expert!) user.
\subsection{Within siena07}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have created a copy of \sfn{DoIterations}, called
  \sfn{DoIterationsCopy}. Moving a `\#' from one call to the other in
  \sfn{proc2subphase} will switch usage. Make your changes to the copy version,
  so you can reinstate the working version by reverting the comment placing.
\item Most of the possible changes are in \sfn{DoIterations}, but I have added
  the facility to use regression rather than a simple average at the end of the
  subphases. This is controlled by a parameter \sfn{useAerage} in
  \sfn{proc2Subphase}, set to \sfn{TRUE} by default. Change it by editing the
  file! You also need to use \sfn{doIterationsCopy} to force the retention of
  all the parameter values and deviations.
\item Within \sfn{doIterationsCopy}, the update step has been removed to a
  function, \sfn{doChangeStep}, and a loop to do importance sampling steps
  inserted. The step continue until the variance of the weights is greater than
  one tenth the value with all mass concentrated at one point., or to 25
  (hard-coded!). A parameter \sfn{numberIterations} controls the number of
  samples used. Default to 10, change it by editing!
\item Flags are available in \sfn{doIterationsCopy} to store the chains and
  change contributions in C. Predicted statistics or scores are obtained from
  the function \sfn{predictOutcomes}, which uses the robust method of
  recalculation of likelihood in C.
\item If you have sourced the file \sfn{algorithms.r}, then other options for
  this calculation could be tried using the functions in that file.
\item There is also a preexisting system for maximum likelihood which just
  recalculates the scores and does another iteration. Based on
  \sfn{doMoreUpdates}.
\item \sfn{doIterationsCopy} will not function with conditional estimation,
and will not do anything sensible with missing data (yet!). So avoid missing
data.
\item You need to set \sfn{returnDeps=TRUE} on the call to \sfn{siena07}.
\item You might want to alter the number of iterations per subphase. This is set
  in the function \sfn{AnnouncePhase} (code in \sfn{siena07.r}).
\item More than two waves, or multigroups, would be very experimental!
\item Beware that the two functions may drift apart over time!
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Standalone}
Use the file \sfn{algorithms.r}. This is in the \sfn{inst/examples} directory in
the source to keep it out of the way of build procedures. (In the examples
directory in the installed package.) Source it to use it. There is no need to
rebuild the package after changing this file. (If it needs functions from the
package it accesses them using \sfn{RSiena:::}.

The basic outline is described here. The parameters are passed to the initialize
routine and then stored on \sfn{z}. I think their use will be fairly clear if
you read what follows (and the code!)

No promises about robustness, and the routine is designed to be hacked rather
than run unchanged. But examples of use are in file \sfn{runalg.r}.

Bayesian routine is not documented here, as it is part of the package and has
a help page.

The graphs are semi-automatic, driven by a dataframe with a column for each
panel. Consult the code to see how it works: construct a formula from the column
names. It is a nice trick. There is no parameter to turn them off: comment them
out.

This has been tested with more than two waves and a main path will work (use the
option to recalculate the change contributions within C) .  Multiple groups I am
less sure about, although it would not need major work.

\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE call initializeFRAN to set data up in C

  \sfn{initialiseFRAN} but I have not pruned thus function.)

\subsubsection{Optim change step}

\subsubsection{Calculating likelihoods and probabilities}
Various functions provided: the differences are the use of C or not and stored
change contributions or not, and which format is most convenient for the final
calculations.
\begin{description}
\item[useC] Uses getProbabilitiesFromCSTore to get hold of the log choices for
  each ministep using change contributions stored in C, and then uses
  getLikelihood3 to do the calculations. Memory intensive but fast. May not be
  robust. Rate values are not stored and rate part of calculation is done in
  R. Only currently works for forward simulation, where it is least useful!
\item[NOT useC AND useSLowC] Uses getProbabilities to pass chain back into C and
  recalculate the chnage contributions to update the ministeps. Fairly quick,
  low memory demand, robust as reuses code that must be maintained. Recommended.
\item[NOT useC and NOT useSlowC] Uses getProbabilitiesR to calculate the choice
  probs using change contributions matrices stored in R. Not recommended unless
  you prefer changing R to C. Slow, memory intensive, and clumsy. Then uses
getLikelihood2 to combine the values.  Only currently works for forward
simulation.
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Set up final iteration}
\label{sec:final}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE set \sfn{diag} flag off so use whole derivative matrix
\STATE reduce the gain to stop erratic behavior
\STATE set number of samples to finalIter
\STATE restart iteration count
\IF {using optim}
\STATE set maxit to 100
\STATE set maxiiter to 0
\STATE set optimFn to optimFinal
\STATE set useOptim to useOptimFinal: could do Newton-Raphson type updates
instead.
\ELSE
\STATE set maxiiter to 20
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
